# i19serial_ui

A PyQt UI to run ssx collections with Bluesky on I19

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from i19serial_ui import __version__

print(f"Hello i19serial_ui {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m i19serial_ui --version
```
